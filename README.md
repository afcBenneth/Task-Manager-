How the Code Works:

1. Create a New File: This option allows the user to create a new file and input text. The user types until they input "END," which stops the input process and saves the file.


2. Edit Existing File: Opens an existing file in append mode and allows the user to add new lines of text. The user also stops input by typing "END."


3. View File Contents: This option displays the contents of a specified file.


4. Exit: Exits the program.
